**Popup** â€” a new feature that allows opening an extended and interactive view of a widget (e.g., the battery charge indicator widget) by clicking on it. Currently, popups are available for the following **barik** widgets: Now Playing, Network, Battery, and Time (Calendar).

We want to make **barik** more useful, powerful, and convenient, so feel free to share your ideas in [Issues](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/issues/new), and contribute your work through [Pull Requests](https://github.com/mocki-toki/barik/pulls). Weâ€™ll definitely review everything!
